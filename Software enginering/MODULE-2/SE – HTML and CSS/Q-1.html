<!-- Website: A website is a collection of related web pages that are typically accessible under a single domain name.
         Websites are hosted on web servers and are designed to be accessed over the internet. Examples of websites
         include Google, Wikipedia, and Amazon.


Webpage: A webpage is a single document on the internet that is written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
         and displayed by a web browser. It can include text, images, videos, links, and other multimedia 
         elements. Webpages are part of websites, and each page usually has a unique URL.


Web Browser: A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view websites and webpages
             on the internet. It interprets HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies to display content
             in a readable and interactive format. Examples of web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,
             Safari, and Microsoft Edge.


Web Server: A web server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers webpages to users' devices when
            requested via a web browser. When a user types a URL or clicks a link, the browser sends a request to 
            the web server, which then responds by sending the requested webpage back to the browser for display.


HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure the content of webpages.
                                  It consists of a series of elements (tags) that define the layout, text, images, and links
                                  on a webpage. HTML provides the structure of a webpage, which is then styled by CSS and made
                                  interactive by JavaScript.


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation (layout, colors, fonts, etc.)
                              of a document written in HTML. CSS separates the visual styling from the HTML structure, allowing
                              developers to change the look and feel of a website without altering the underlying HTML. This makes
                              it easier to maintain and update the website's design.
